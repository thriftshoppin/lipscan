# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **New: `claude/skills/cyberpunk-face-viewer`.** A Claude skill that builds a local 3D face viewer from the user's own Cyberpunk 2077 install:
  - a character-pack converter, using WolvenKit
  - the face-solver math, rebuilt from the game's facial setup
  - a one-file offline viewer with play/pause, a timeline, A/B comparison and a pose tester

  No game data or prebuilt viewer is distributed.
- **Docs:** the WolvenKit guide now explains the facial setup, and that the CLI can't re-import animations.
